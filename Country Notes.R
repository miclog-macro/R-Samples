### FED
Fed_notes.1.31.19 <-
  "5/1/19 FOMC statement: Maintain 2.25%-2.5% FFR. The Committee maintained the target
range of the Fed Funds Rate pointing to slowing economic activity, noting slower growth
of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter. Additionally,
Powell included that the Committee will take into account 'readings on financial and international developments'
in determining future adjustments to the target range."

### CHINA
China_notes.1 <-
"Facing elevated risks from trade war with U.S.
U.S. has threatened 25% on the remaining $300b of Chinese imports.
Economy supported by private consumption."
China_notes.2 <-
"Foreign investment law, passed on March 15, likely to attract more investment over
the long term. Speed at which it was passed indicates China willing to concede some
in trade negotiations."
China_notes.3 <-
"Monetary easing: Additional stimulus taking the form of more local
bond issuance to support provincial and municipal spending, cuts to value-added
taxes to help manufacturers and exporters and further reductions to the reserve
requirement ratio for most commercial banks, which should lower financing costs
and free up capital for more loans to businesses and consumers. Corporate debt
still high but has stablized at 2016 levels."
China_notes.4 <-
"Risk: China's overall debt level remains elevated,
and there exists the possibility that the economy's
extensive debt overhang could lead to a rapidrise in bad debts,
cascading defaults, and a significant downturn in economic growth"

### RUSSIA
Russia_notes.1 <-
"Putin's March 2018 victory indicates a continuation of a tough foreign policy stance
towards the West and economic policy that will be weak on delivering reforms."
Russia_notes.2 <-
"Russia's central bank cut interest rates by 0.25% for the first time in a year
to 7.5%, citing easing inflationary pressure and lowering yields on sovereign debt. Russia
holds high f/x reserves and maintains a current account surplus. Growth outlook dependent
on oil prices. Growth outlook is weak in the absence of a ramp of structural reforms (inflexibility
of the labor force; pension reforms). Outlook further clouded by potential escalation of political
tensions and an undershooting of oil prices."
Russia_notes.3 <-
"U.S. withdrew from INF treaty. This provides the opportunity for Russia to build
more nukes without restrictions. Putin likely to
increase national debt to service defense sector which would further depress the RUB.
U.S. can deploy missiles to countries much closer to Russia than when it could
30 years ago. But allies may oppose taking missiles as it could lead them to be targets."
Russia_notes.4 <-
"Track:
1) Willingness of allies in Eastern Europe and Asia to accept missile deployment
2) US defense contracts with foreign allies"

### ARGENTINA
ARG_notes.1 <-
"Received $50bn IMF loan in June 2018. Peso devalued over 50% in 2018.
President Macri, who was intially positive for the economy, has seen his approval
ratings fall. He will likely face a contentious re-election in October 2018."
ARG_notes.2 <-
"Recession likely to continue through 2019. Rebounding agricultural harvests will
provide near-term support to economic activity and consumption is likely to
pick up over the coming quarters."
ARG_notes.3 <-
"Weak investor sentiment will keep investment on the sidelines,
inflation is elevated and fiscal consolidation efforts will curtail
investment and consumption, lifting risks."

### Japan
Japan_notes.1 <-
"Exports fell for 7th straight month in May YoY. BOJ may be forced to offer more
stimulus to temper the effects of slowing external demand and trade frictions."
Japan_notes.2 <-
"April BOJ Meeting: BOJ voted (7-2) to keep monetary policy unchanged.
Short rate negative, 10-year around 0% and annual pace of purchases at
JPY80trn will be maintained. Given weaker global economy, BOJ likely to maintain
position through 2019."
